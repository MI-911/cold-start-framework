# Cold-start Framework
Data partitioning, model training and evaluation pipelines for the cold-start setting.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.8 is required. 
Install all required dependencies with `python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements` from the project root. 

## Data partitioning
To partition training and testing data sets, run `./data_partitioner/partition_cold_start.py`. The script will create a `data/` directory and put the necessary data files in there.

## Running experiments
