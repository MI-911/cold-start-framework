# Cold-start Framework
Data partitioning, model training and evaluation pipelines for the cold-start setting.

## Prerequisites
Python >= 3.7 is required. 
Install all required dependencies with `python3.7 -m pip install -r requirements` from the project root. 

## Data partitioning
To partition training and testing data sets, run `./partitioners/partition_interview.py`. The script will create a `data/` directory that holds the data.

## Running experiments
